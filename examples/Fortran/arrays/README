The arrays_write.F90 example shows how to write out an array the simplest way 
from a Fortran code. 

Note that each process writes an array with the same name and dimension
into the arrays.bp file if the MPI method is used. 
Only one of them can be seen with the generic read API and tools based on 
this API like bpls. 

However, you can read each array in with the specific API on the same number
of processors you write them out (see arrays_read.F90)

How to build the code on your own:

1. Generate the gwrite/gread include files from the XML file
    $ gpp.py arrays.xml
    $ ls *.fh
    gread_arrays.fh  gwrite_arrays.fh

2. Compile and link the code, with environment variables ADIOS_DIR pointing
   to the ADIOS installation directory and MXML_DIR pointing to the MXML
   installation directory (substitute mpif90 with your F90 compiler):
   $ mpif90 -o arrays_write arrays_write.F90 -I${ADIOS_DIR}/include \
            -L${ADIOS_DIR}/lib -ladiosf -L${MXML_DIR}/lib -lmxml
   $ mpif90 -o arrays_read arrays_read.F90 -I${ADIOS_DIR}/include \
            -L${ADIOS_DIR}/lib -ladiosf -L${MXML_DIR}/lib -lmxml
